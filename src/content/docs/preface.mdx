Welcome! This guide is my take on trying to teach the wonders of Nix and NixOS from scratch.
This will comprise of many parts, and we'll only *install* the OS later on. This guide prioritizes getting a safe environment for you to learn in over getting NixOS installed fully right away.

## Prerequisites

This guide will depend on you being on a Linux distro, as Nix is for Linux (and MacOS) only.

In addition you should be familiar with a few concepts.

1. Linux in general
2. Programming (even better, functional programming)
3. Git

## Reading

This guide makes use of a few visual aids.

Code blocks will be obvious against all other text, you can view the name of the file you should be editing in the tab at the top.

```nix title="file.nix"
# Look at the tab!
```

There will be times when you'll need to replace parts of a code block with stuff specific to you. When this happens that part of the code will be highlighted.

```nix title="file.nix" "REPLACE THIS!"
# A line
# another line
# REPLACE THIS!
```

Finally, to keep things clean I'll often omit part of files. This will be denoted with `...`.

```nix title="file.nix"
# ...

# the important part

# ...
```

## Ready?

That's about all you need to know before starting. Thank you for reading!
