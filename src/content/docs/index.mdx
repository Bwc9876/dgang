## Why Another Guide?

<del>Idk why not</del>. This guide tries to start you out with VMs instead of installing NixOS fully to try and ease you into it. 
You learn how to make and configure a NixOS system in a virtual machine (configured from your host system with simple text files)
and then go into actually installing the system after you can learn and experiment with Nix/NixOS.
