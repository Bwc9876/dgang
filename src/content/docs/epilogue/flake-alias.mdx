title: Using Your Flake for nix run
description: Updating your flake and `nix` config to allow you to use your own flake for `nix run` over `nixpkgs`
---

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Currently when you run `nix run nixpkgs#python3`, nix will checkout the latest `nixpkgs` and grab `python3`

This poses three potential problems

1. Having to redownload nixpkgs is a bit much
2. If your package is marked unfree or insecure and you allowed it explicitly in your nix config previously, that exception won't apply here.
3. Overlays will not be applied

## Setting up a Flake Alias

To fix this, we can expose the instance of `nixpkgs` that we make in `flake.nix` to the `nix` CLI.

<Steps>
1. Add a new output in `flake.nix` for `legacyPackages`
    ```nix title="flake.nix" ins={4}
    outputs = inputs @ {
        ...
    }: ... {
        legacyPackages.${system} = pkgs;
    }
    ```
2. In your nix configuration, add an entry to the flake registry
    ```nix title="nix.nix" /"(p)"/ ins=" inputs," ins={4}
    {pkgs, inputs, ...}: {
        nix = {
            # ...
            registry."p".flake = inputs.self;
        };
    }
    ```
    I use `p` here as that's what I use in my config, you can change this to any string (I recommend a short one).
3. Rebuild and switch
</Steps>

Now, whenever you want to run/shell a package, use `p` (or whatever alias you set up) instead of `nixpkgs`.

```sh
nix run p#python3
```

This will use the instance of nixpkgs that your flake exports, with all of your config and overlays applied!
